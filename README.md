# 🚀 E-Commerce Seller Performance Dashboard  
An end-to-end data analytics project using Python, SQL (MySQL), and Power BI_

📊 In this project, I simulated a real-world scenario where an e-commerce platform needs to monitor and improve its seller ecosystem. The pipeline begins with synthetic data generation using Python (`pandas`, `faker`), followed by relational schema creation in MySQL, SQL-based business analysis, and interactive dashboarding with Power BI.

The objective is to uncover actionable insights into seller behavior, product quality, audit compliance, and inventory management—exactly the type of holistic analysis required in data-driven business environments. During the dashboarding stage in Power BI, I pragmatically adjusted a few SQL queries (e.g., removed filters like "last 90 days" or "low ratings only") to ensure a sufficient and balanced dataset for meaningful visualization across KPIs, categories, and regions.

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Seller performance ranking by region (based on ratings & order volume)  
- 🚩 Identification of underperforming sellers for follow-up or training  
- 📉 Low-rated product detection for quality control  
- 📋 Audit compliance monitoring across sellers  
- 📦 Inventory bottlenecks detection (low stock, high demand)  
- 🎯 Custom SQL tuning for dashboard completeness and data richness

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- `Python` (Data Generation via Jupyter Notebook)  
- `MySQL` (Relational Database & Querying)  
- `SQL` (Joins, Aggregates, CTEs, Window Functions)  
- `Power BI` (Visualization & Dashboarding)

## 💼 Outcome

This project demonstrates the workflow of a data analyst from data creation and storage to business analysis and visualization. The integration of Python, SQL, and Power BI replicates a real-world analytics pipeline used by companies to make informed decisions based on data. Adjusting SQL queries during visualization reflects an analyst’s need to tailor data contextually for presentation, while maintaining analytical integrity.

## 📁 Project Components

- `ecom.ipynb` – Python notebook for generating and uploading synthetic data  
- `schema_file.sql` – MySQL schema creation for structured storage  
- `seller_performane.sql`, `audit_complaince.sql`, etc. – SQL analysis scripts  
- `dashboard.pbix` – Final Power BI dashboard with KPIs and insights  
  *(includes modified queries for improved data visual representation)*
